##Book Genre Prediction
This project aims to predict the genre of a book based on its textual data using machine learning techniques. The notebook demonstrates various steps in preprocessing the data, applying different models, and evaluating their performance.

Project Structure
The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook that includes the following components:

1. Data Loading and Exploration
Data is loaded and initially explored using pandas to understand its structure and key attributes.
Visualizations are created with matplotlib and seaborn to analyze the distribution of genres and other features.
2. Text Preprocessing
Text data is cleaned and preprocessed using:
Regular expressions (re) to remove unwanted characters.
nltk for tokenization and stop word removal.
Feature extraction with TfidfVectorizer and CountVectorizer.
3. Model Selection
Several machine learning algorithms are applied for classification:
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Naive Bayes (GaussianNB, MultinomialNB)
Support Vector Machine (SVC)
4. Model Evaluation
The models are evaluated using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
The performance of each classifier is compared to select the best one for genre prediction.

Project Overview
This project explores how different machine learning models perform on a book genre classification task. Through data preprocessing, vectorization of textual data, and training multiple classifiers, we aim to achieve a high accuracy in predicting the genres of books based on available text data.

Future Enhancements
Include deep learning models such as LSTM or transformers for improved text classification.
Perform hyperparameter tuning to further optimize the models.
Expand the dataset with more book features (e.g., author, publication year) for better predictions.
